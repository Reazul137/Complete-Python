1. <b>Introduction and setting Up Python.</b>
<p> At first we need to download to Python itself so that we can access it.
Go to python website(www.python.org) and download the latest python file 3.5(version) or more. And install the file,
Then we need to setup an IDE(Integrated development environment), in IDE we can run our python program, some IDE are, pycharm, spyder etc. </p>

2. <b>Comments.</b>
<p> Using comments within your Python programs helps to make your programs more readable for humans, including your future self. Including appropriate comments that are relevant and useful can make it easier for others to collaborate with you on programming projects and make the value of your code more obvious. Comments in Python begin with a <b>hash mark (#)</b> and <b>whitespace
character</b> and continue to the end of the line </p>

I. <b>Understanding Data Types</b>
<p>In Python, like in all programming languages, data types are used to classify one particular type of data. This is important because the specific data type you use will determine what values you can assign to it and what you can do to it (including what operations you can perform on it). </p>
<b>Data Types in Python : </b>
<p> 1. Python Numbers<br>
    2. Python List<br>
    3. Python Tuple<br>
    4. Python Strings<br>
    5. Python Set<br>
    6. Python Dictionary<br>
    7. Conversion between data types</p><br>

3. <b>Displaying Input / Output / Data With The Print Function and more.</b>
<p>when we build interactive software applications. We want the end users to enter some data or to input some data that our application will use. And at some point our application will send some data back to the end user or display some output to the user.
so, to perform these two input and output operations in a standalone python program we use the <b>input()</b> function and the <b>print()</b> functions.</p>

4. <b>Variables.</b>
<p>Python is dynamically typed, which means that you don't have to declare what
type each variable is. In Python, variables are a storage placeholder for texts and numbers. It must have a name so that you are able to find it again. The variable is always assigned with the equal sign, followed by the value of the variable.</p>

5. <b>Variable Naming Rules.</b>
<p>Must begin with a letter <b>(a - z, A - B) or underscore (_)</b> Other characters can be letters, numbers or _
Case Sensitive. Can be any (reasonable) length. There are some reserved words which you cannot use as a variable name because Python uses them for other things.</p>
